        <p>A mystery, yet so familiar <br>
            An unheard melody, but I've caught the notes <br>
            To think about it... <br>
            "Have we met before?" those words echoed.

    <div class="title"><h1>Their First Symphony</h1></div>
    <div class="descrip"><p>Their First Symphony begins with high school senior, Jenna McCartney stepping into campus for the first time after spending most of her life homeschooled.
        She was immediately adopted into a new group on her first week. Everyone welcomed her warmly. Though it wasn't always easy for her to adapt to a new setting. <br><br>

        Grayson Sanders was one of the people who welcomed their new fellow senior. It wasn't difficult befriending her, mostly because the others had done all the work and you just don't have to 
        view her frequent silence as a threat. <br><br>

        One thing they couldn't fathom though, is the sense of familiarity they have with each other in every interaction. They did learn that they've originated from the same world, but it seems like there's more. 
        It's as though they've always known each other.

<h2>Symphonièr</h2>
<p>Symphonièr is a world made out of music and everyone is made of it and surrounded by it. We bearers have an ability to use the soul music, 
    the indwelling magic that springs from the power of music, to do different things. This is where Jenna and Grayson came from.

<h2>The Mundane Realm</h2>
<p>The Mundane Realm is the world we dwell in. "Earth" would've been the most familiar term. This is where Grayson and Jenna reside for half of the story.</p>
